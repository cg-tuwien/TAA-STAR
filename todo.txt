TODOs:

	raytracing:
		using separate, duplicated index/vertex buffers (and others) for now... need to extend some avk functions, esp. for AS building
		add subpixel jittering so taa can work on raytraced image? do we need that actually?
		ok - animated objects?
		do proper alpha-blending for transparents (accumulate hit counts + alpha-scaled colors) - need to traverse in ray sequence?
		ok - use main shadow settings to enable/disable raytraced shadows
		lighting looks different from raster version in test scene?
		do normal mapping
		dark spots in anim-models are self-shadows.. need very high tmin
		refactor tlas/blas rebuilding
		determine mip level for texture sampling? -> see papers "Improved Shader and Texture Level of Detail Using Ray Cones" and "Texture Level of Detail Strategies for Real-Time Ray Tracing"
		is it really necessary to update TLAS after updating BLAS?



	still problems with slow-mo when capturing frames - use /frame instead of /sec when capturing for now!

	ok - move any buffer updates from update() to render()! Update can be called for fif, if previous (same) fif is still executing!

	- frustum culling notes:					startup view/view at park (Emerald Square, no shadows, taa on)
		- before separate scene data:			29/42 ms
			per-fif buffers: same
			host_coherent instead of device:	31/45
		- with first version cpu culling:		10.5/35		(dev buffers)
												10.8/37		(host-coherent buffers)
		- second version:						~same results
		- first version GPU culling:            11/36 (but now ~same with CPU - due to new/changed buffer setup?)


	ok - avoid necessity of re-recording command buffers with culling (use vkCmdDrawIndexedIndirectCount)

	- shadows: need backface culling disabled - why? something to do with upside-down shadow camera?

	- Performance! Esp. w/ shadows!
	  Note: shadows of transparent obj. consumes much time, but NOT due to sampling diff. texture (diff=only ~2ms at ES park) ! It's just the amount of additional objects

	ok Shadows: remove manual bias, add polygon offsets

	- cleanup TODO list ;-)   remove obsolete stuff, add notes from scratchpads

	ok - do on-GPU visibility culling?

	- make mDynObjectInstances (so we can have more than one instance of a model - need to move prevTransform etc. there)

	- TAAU: WHY subtract jitter instead of add
	- TAAU: with 4x upsampling and 4 samples -> why are there no "holes" in history? (because hist is cleared to full image?)
	- TAAU: still some bugs? examine sponza lionhead border with 4xup

	- soccerball model is badly reduced, has some holes

	- moving objs with more than one mesh/material

	- when using deferred shading - any point in using a compute shader for the lighting pass ?

	- motion vectors problems, like: object coming into view from behind an obstacle. tags?

	- is there any point to keep using 2 render-subpasses in forward rendering?

	- recheck lighting, esp. w.r.t. twosided materials

	- fix changed lighting flags in deferred shader

	- shadows?

	- need different alpha thresholds for blending/not blending

	NOTES:
	- transparency pass without blending isn't bad either - needs larger alpha threshold ~0.5
